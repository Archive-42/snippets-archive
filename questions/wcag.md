### What is WCAG? What are the differences between A, AA, and AAA compliance?

#### Answer

WCAG stands for "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines". It is a standard describing how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities
They have 12-13 guidelines and for each one, there are testable success criteria, which are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA. The higher the level, the higher the impact on the design of the web content. The higher the level, the web content is essentially more accessible by more users.
Depending on where you live/work, there may be regulations requiring websites to meet certain levels of compliance. For instance, in Ontario, Canada, beginning January 1, 2021 all public websites and web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet AA compliance.

#### Good to hear

- A guideline for making web content more accessible
- 3 different levels (A, AA, and AAA) of compliance for each guideline
- Governments are starting to require web content to meet a certain level of compliance by law
